## **Project Name**

The Corona Wiki

## **Description**

*Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why.*

With the recent Coronavirus outbreak, we’re witnessing mass hysteria about what to do and how to stay safe. To add to the confusion, there are multiple news sources that report on new tidbits of information on a local, statewide, national, and international level.

**The Corona Wiki** serves to be a central hub of all info COVID-19-related where users can filter information by the region they live in, keep up with ongoing developments through sources like WHO and the CDC, have access to resources and debunk myths relating to the virus.

In the age of an exaggerated media landscape and overwhelming information consumption, the purpose of **The Corona Wiki** is to give users/ordinary people a sense of security and a streamlined sense of understanding as they navigate through the unchartered waters of disease control.

## **Objectives**

1. **Create a Wiki with info on COVID-19**

    *Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?*

    It is the main focus of this project, to get information out there.

    *How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?*

    There will be a react frontend populated with articles regarding coronavirus

2. **Build a timeline noting significant events regarding COVID-19**

    *Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?*

    The media is pushing new content every minute on the coronavirus. This can make it difficult for people who want to be updated on the virus to understand what's changing.  A timeline is the best way to visualize all that's been happening since the beginning of the outbreak. 

    *How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?*

    We plan on building the timeline in React and using the web scraper to gather articles.

3. **A map of locations where a user can get tested for COVID-19**

    *Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?*

    Right now, the US is struggling to keep up with the growing number of people who are getting COVID-19, making it harder to get an accurate estimate of how many people are actually diagnosed with the virus. A map displaying all the testing centers available can make it easier for users to get a firm diagnosis and get the appropriate treatment.

    *How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?*

    There will be a map with markers with available testing locations across the United States.

## **Stretch goals (optional):**

*What stretch goals do you have for your project?*

- Providing our own set of data analysis
- Building a templating system so when there are future breakouts, we can use the same tools used to build this project

## **Challenges I Anticipate**

*List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project.*

### **Omar Sagoo**

- Writing out this project in `node.js`, which is a language I haven't used in a while
- Finding accurate information to display on the website

## **Skateboard**

*ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc. Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.*

- Build a web scraper that can gather basic information of articles (title, author, date published, link to article) from one newspaper source (The Washington Post).
- Create a timeline that displays the statistics (# of confirmed, deaths, and recovered) of each day since the start of the outbreak

## **Bike**

*ONE additional feature that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use.*

- The web scraper can gather information from different media sources
- The timeline can use the articles gathered from the web scraper and organize them in the date they were published

## **Car**

*ONE additional feature.*

- The web scraper can categorize the articles based on topic (government policies, updates on a vaccine, etc.)
- The timeline can summarize the important events that happened each day by using NLP to find info that are prevalent in most articles.

*Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.*
